Awaken, O dreamer, the stars call your name,
No mountain too mighty, no fire too tame.
You were born for the challenge, the climb, the fight,
To learn, to code, to chase the light.

With lazy mornings and dreams that roam,
The world waits for the mind you own.
AI and logic at your command,
Just take the first step, make your stand.

Python’s lines will bend your will,
DSA will sharpen every skill.
Speak with power, let English flow,
Each word a spark, each phrase a glow.

Failures may knock, doubt may tease,
But champions rise when others freeze.
Breathe in purpose, exhale fear—
The master you seek is already here.

So rise again, don’t waste the day,
The stars won't wait, they light your way.
Just one more page, one line, one try—
And you’ll outgrow even the sky.
