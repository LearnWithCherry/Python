Once upon a time in the village of Donkey ville, there lived a Donkey  named Donkey  Das
Donkey  Das was no ordinary Donkey  — he was the chief of the Donkey  army, protector of the Donkey  Gate, and winner of the annual Donkey  Dance-Off
Every morning, Donkey  Das would wake up, brush his Donkey  teeth, polish his Donkey  hooves, and put on his Donkey  shades before trotting down the Donkey  path to the Donkey  Café
There, he'd sip a hot cup of Donkey latte and read the Donkey  Daily, the only newspaper made entirely by Donkey s, for Donkey s
