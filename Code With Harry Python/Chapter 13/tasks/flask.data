🚀 What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that allows you to build web applications quickly and easily.

It’s called a micro framework because:

It is lightweight

It doesn’t force any specific tools or libraries

You can add only what you need (plugins, database, etc.)

Think of Flask as the skeleton of a website — you bring the muscles, brain, and style.

🔧 Why Use Flask?
✅ Simple and beginner-friendly

✅ Great for API development

✅ Used in backend of real-world apps

✅ Python-based (so you already know how to code it!)

✅ Huge community and libraries

🛠️ How to Use Flask (Basic Steps)
Let’s break it into a small checklist:

✅ 1. Install Flask
Inside your virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask
✅ 2. Create a Flask App File (e.g. app.py)
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Cherry! Flask is working!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
✅ 3. Run the Flask App
In terminal or VS Code:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
✅ 4. Visit in Browser
Open this in your browser:

cpp
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Boom 💥! You just served a website from your own code.

🧪 Common Flask Use Cases
Use Case	What Flask Does
Personal portfolio	Host it as a website
Contact forms	Handle input and send emails
AI tools	Turn your model into a web app
APIs	Send/receive data to/from other apps
Admin panels	Build dashboards and tools

🔮 What's Next After Basics?
Once you're comfy with Flask:

Use HTML templates with render_template()

Add forms and GET/POST methods

Connect to a database (like SQLite or MySQL)

Build REST APIs

Deploy it online using Render, Vercel, or Heroku

💬 Real World Example?
If you’ve seen websites like:

To-do apps

Chatbots

AI tools where you input text and get a reply

They often use Flask in the backend!

🎯 Cherry's Goal Path in Flask:
✅ Understand Flask basics

🔜 Learn render_template() and serve HTML

🔜 Handle forms & input

🔜 Connect Python logic (like AI or ML models!)

🔜 Deploy to web!
