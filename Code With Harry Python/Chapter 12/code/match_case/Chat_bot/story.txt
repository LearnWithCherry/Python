Aryan wanted to become an AI master, but he was super lazy.
He'd open Python, stare at the screen, and do… nothing.

One night, his laptop glitched.
A message popped up:

Just write one line. I'll help you. — GPT

He typed: print("Hello, future")

The screen flashed:
Well done. Do it again tomorrow.

And he did.
One line became one page.
One project became a career.
And the lazy boy? He built an AI that changed the world.
